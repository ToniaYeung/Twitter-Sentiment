#### Twitter sentiments 

This project investigates popular opinion in Hong Kong by scraping data and feeding it into world clouds. 

The word clouds are created by retrieving and parsing tweets from the Twitter API that were filtered by a sixteen-mile radius from the centre of Hong Kong. The size and/or boldness of each word correlates to its frequency and this usually means the bigger the word the more significant it is. They are often used to spot patterns or emphasis in particular situations.
